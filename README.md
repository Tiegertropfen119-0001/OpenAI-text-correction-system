### How to Use
To use this system, you need to install the `requests` and `json` packages via pip. I used Python 3.11 on Windows.

After installing the required packages, you need to enter your OpenAI API token at `OPENAI_API_KEY = "token"`. Then, you can launch `main.py` by typing `py main.py` in the terminal.

### Additional Information
Please note that the price calculation may be incorrect. You can get an API token on the official OpenAI website at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
